I﻿ passed the Microsoft SC-900 exam!

[![Verify on Credly](/images/microsoft-certified-security-compliance-and-identity-fundamentals.png)](https://go.rikdeakin.uk/SC90)

Click the badge above to [verify](https://go.rikdeakin.uk/SC90) my Microsoft Certified Security Compliance and Identity Fundamentals certification on credly.

Microsoft's course was pretty good, although I wouldn't say this is an easy certification, simply because the naming and crossover of MS' security and GRC products is quite confusing.

I﻿ found the following short course on youtube to be useful. The content seemed rushed, there were a few mistakes here and there, but on the whole it is a good way to quickly brush-up on the course material.

I﻿ got a free exam voucher for this course from Microsoft, from attending one of their [Microsoft Virtual Training Days](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/events/training-days/) events. And so can you! But wait, there's more! Keep an eye on that page, because they offer free training and exams for lots of different certifications.
