F﻿irstly, thanks for visiting my site!

T﻿his is my personal online profile, which I'll keep updated with important news and links.

This site is based upon an open source project on GitHub, called Hylia.

If you want to make an image bleed-out, add a title attribute to it and the front-end will automatically wrap it in a `<figure>` tag for you.

You can also add videos to posts from YouTube or Vimeo (or wherever, really) and the front-end will also make those bleed-out for you too.

Hopefully, this has demonstrated how simple it is to make a nice looking blog with Hylia.
